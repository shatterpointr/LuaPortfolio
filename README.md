# Lua Portfolio
Welcome!
This repository contains a few code samples from two different projects I've worked on.
Showcases of the code functioning are available at the below links

The combat system was made purely for fun by myself. I was a huge fan of different fighting games on ROBLOX and was particularly inspired by Shinobi Life II. I wanted to explore what the backend of the basic combat systems of those sorts of games could be like. I set up a simple 4 punch string system, the ability to block, and dash, with the addition of guardbreaking at the end of the combat string. The animations and particle effects are rough, but also done by me. I made this several years ago, so the particular style of the programming is different than the training system, which I made more recently.

The training system was made for a Clone Army roleplay group I worked as a developer for. The project the system was made to be used in is no longer in development, and I am no longer working as a developer for the group. It was intended to serve as a guided system for hosting the basic trainings for new members to attend and earn points towards promotions. The full sequence included jumping jacks, faces, obstacle courses of varying difficulty, and 1 on 1 duels. Trainees earned points dependent on their performance in each phase, which then was posted through the HTTP service to the group's Clanlabs subscription which could automate XP awarding and handle promotions through the ranks. The system also had webhook integration to announce the starting of new trainings in the group discord, as well as log the end of trainings in a log channel with the host, participants, and the XP they gained. Plans were made to integrate this with the group's officer training hosting quota system through Trello's API, but the project fell apart before I could finish the trello wrapper. As it stands, the system is more or less complete bar integration testing and subsequent hell, but I hope the code samples and showcase video serve my portfolio well.
